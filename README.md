### Topological Neural Networks

This is the repo for a post on topological nueral networks and their properties and potential applications in social networks, protein networks and recommender systems. This post is heavily inspired by the distill post on [graph neural networks](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/). 


### To run the demo

1. Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

2. Watch the demo for changes with a local server:

```
yarn start
```

The demo can then be accessed at http://localhost:1234/


### To make updates

- Make edits to `index.html`
- Run `yarn build`
- Push to `origin/main`
