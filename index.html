  <h1>Topological Neural Networks: Going beyond Graph data</h1>
  <p>Neural networks have been adapted to leverage the structure and properties of graphs. We explore the components needed for building a topological neural network, differences between a graph neural network and a topological neural network
    and how the topological neural network is an abstraction of a graph neural network - and motivate the design choices behind them. </p>

  for giving better context. The faces which are highlighted in blue indicate the higher order relationships.

<p>Graphs have garnered interest with applicability in various fields such as semantics in machine translation. 
  user geolocation, relation extraction,analyzing structures of molecules and protein interface prediction. 
  Despite the success of Graphs in various deep learning applications, seeing graphs purely through a geometric point of view
  can

<p><strong>Citation networks as graphs.</strong> Scientists routinely cite other scientists’ work when publishing papers. We can visualize these networks of citations as a graph, where each paper is a node, and each <em>directed</em> edge is a citation between one paper and another. Additionally, we can add information about each paper into each node, such as a word embedding of the abstract. (see <d-cite key="Mikolov2013-vr"></d-cite>,  <d-cite key="Devlin2018-mi"></d-cite> ,  <d-cite key="Pennington2014-kg"></d-cite>). </p>
<p><strong>Other examples.</strong> In computer vision, we sometimes want to tag objects in visual scenes. We can then build graphs by treating these objects as nodes, and their relationships as edges. <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/graphs">Machine learning models</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJOFETxR-">programming code</a> <d-cite key="Allamanis2017-kz"></d-cite> and <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1eZYeHFDS">math equations</a><d-cite key="Lample2019-jg"></d-cite> can also be phrased as graphs, where the variables are nodes, and edges are operations that have these variables as input and output. You might see the term “dataflow graph” used in some of these contexts.</p>
<p>The structure of real-world graphs can vary greatly between different types of data — some graphs have many nodes with few connections between them, or vice versa. Graph datasets can vary widely (both within a given dataset, and between datasets) in terms of the number of nodes, edges, and the connectivity of nodes.</p>
